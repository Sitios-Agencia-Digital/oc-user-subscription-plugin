## Features

1. Cater Verified Users Only

    - Enabling "verify via email" toggle in the settings page allows you to filter spam users and only serve the verified ones.

2. Efficiently Manage Outgoing Traffic
    - Websites containing more than one subscription segments can create categories for each segment using the plugin. Visitors to the website can only subscribe to segments which they are interested in.

3. Useful Graphs and Charts
